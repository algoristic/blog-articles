# What matters in Manga?

On the first hand: I mostly read _Seinen_ Manga.

## The three factors that make a Manga worth reading

I have thoroughly thought about the key elements that set the base for every Manga I love. I am a great fan of Fantasy and Science Fiction but some of my favourite Manga are the very realistic biography of the greatest Samurai of all time, Miyamoto Musashi, _Vagabond_ by Takehiko Inoue or the fast paced Psycho-Thriller _Monster_ by Naoki Urasawa. So it has to be something else. I also adore a fine art and realistic drawings but yet I really enjoyed the sketchy and vague style of Tsutomu Nihei's _BLAME!_. Another point is, that i generally prefer more mature stories. Especially here I think that most Comics, that target an older audience, have a special ruthlessness when it comes to violence and maturity. Still, in most cases, I would prefer any _Seinen_ Manga over e. g. any DC Comic.

After some hard thinking I was able to break it down to three factors that, in their combination, make a Manga worth reading for myself. Keep in mind: this is my opinion and focuses very much on my experience with Manga. I am far from having read any story that I plan to do. But let's get started; after discussing the factors I will continue and describe my opinion on what's the key difference between japanese Manga and western Comics.

### Art

- is a medium for general direction and expression of the story
- mention vagabond, blame, berserk

### Setting and Story

- have to be consistent and complementary
- mention (negative) drifting dragons
- mention (positive) vinland saga

### Characters

- deep, background story
- mention (positive) vinland saga, blade of the immortal
- mention (negative) ???
